Jameson Black Barrel is a tribute to our coopers, who painstakingly give their barrels an additional charring - an age-old method for invigorating barrels to intensify the taste and reveal their untold richness and complexity. The unique blend is then matured in a combination of American oak, sherry casks and double charred bourbon barrels. Time spent maturing in these double-charred barrels lends our whiskey a unique richness, with more intensified notes of vanilla sweetness and caramel, alongside toasted wood, fruit, and warm spice.
